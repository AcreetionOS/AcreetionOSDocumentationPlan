** The purpose of this guide is to give an overview of what we expect from contributors who wish to contribute to the project. These rules must be followed, or we may deny different commits, pull requests, etc. **

## Code of Conduct

Please make sure to look over the Code of Conduct! It's important to understand the behavior we will allow here!

## Asking Questions

Look int he *Issue Template* We tell you what we need from you! Thank you for being interested in our project!

## Opening Issues

Please make sure to follow the outline of the *Issue Template*, it allows for us to have a stream-lined workflow, meaning we can address your problems faster and get the problems fixed faster! Thanks!

## Wanting A Feature? 
If you want a feature, read our *Issue Template* It tells you how to ask for a feature! If you don't do as is said, it probably won't get done! We want to see your work or idea happen, so follow the rules please!

## Submitting Pull Requests
Make sure to read the *Pull Request Template* before you submit a pull request. Those are the criteria we are going to use when we decide to accept the pull request or not!

## Commit Message Criteria
We have a standardized set of requirements for Commit Messages. The reason for this is to make it where everybody is on board and understand what the commit messages are referring to! Thank you for reading the *Commit Messages* template, which has a few examples and why they are worded how they are!

## Code Requirements
As of now we aren't pushing any FULL restrictions.

## Credits
Make sure to follow the license of this project. It saves headaches for everyone involved. And please, make sure to point back to us if you share our work. It is jus the respectful thing to do! We want the project to reach far and wide! Thank you so much!
