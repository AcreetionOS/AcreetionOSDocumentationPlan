# Feature Requests

If you want a feature to be added to the project. Make sure to document what the feature does, attempt to make the feature yourself and include your fork link, with the git commit ID. In the case you just have an idea but don't know how to implement it, put [IDEA] as the beginning of the issue.

# How to ask a question

In the AcreetionOS Project, we have a very specific way to ask your questions so we can as many questions as possibe for those who wish to contribute.

The Template: 

My Project: \
What I've tried: \
My Problem [if one exists]: \
What I need from you: \
Importance [Low; Medium; High]"



If you have questions, we are happy to answer them. Make sure you put the level of importance at the beginning of the issue by doing [Low], [Medium] [High].

Ex:
~~~
[Low] I want feature 1... but how do I do x,y,z?
~~~
Maintainers will close templates that are falsely represented.
