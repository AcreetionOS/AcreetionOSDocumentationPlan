# AcreetionOS Linux: Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction
The AcreetionOS Linux project is an x86_64 as of 2024. It supports basic packages for the user environment stable, but it does not add bloat, but instead gives the user choice on what they would like to download for their own usecase.

## 2. System Architecture

AcreetionOS Linux follows a modular architecture, built on top of the Linux kernel. The system is composed of the following major components:

### User Applications
|Self-Created| Community Created|
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| CInstaller |Archinstall     |
|            |Mate Terminal |
|            |gedit|
|            |VS Code |
|            |Nano|
|            |VI|
|            |xviewer
|            |xreader

[Full package list]("https://darrengames.ddns.net:30008/cobra3282000/AcreetionOS/src/branch/main/packages.x86_64")


### Desktop Environment
***Cinnamon***, *Mate, XFCE*

### System Services 
*Lightdm* \
*timeshift* \
*Pamac Update Service*
    

### Package Manager
*Pacman, AUR, Flatpak* 

### Init System
*Systemd*

### Linux Kernel
*Zen-Kernel*

### Hardware
*x86_64*


### 2.1 Linux Kernel

At the core of AcreetionOS Linux, we are using the Zen Kernel, a kernel with a variety of extra patches for performance improvements. It is managed by The Zen Kernel team found at https://github.com/zen-kernel/zen-kernel. 

### 2.2 Init System

AcreetionOS Linux uses systemd as its init system and service manager, handling the boot process and managing system services.

### 2.3 System Services

These include essential daemons and background processes such as:
- NetworkManager for network configuration
- Pipewire for audio management
- Xorg for display server

### 2.5 Desktop Environment
AcreetionOS uses the Cinnamon Desktop Environment on its flagship edition. On the secondary editions AcreetionOS Mate and XFCE will use Mate and XFCE respectively.


## 3. Key Subsystems
Pacman - package management
Gnome-keyring - GPG Key management
OpenSSH - If the user wants to use SSH
Lightdm - Login Manager
Cinnamon - Desktop Environment



### 3.1 Boot Process

1. Systemd-boot
2. Linux kernel initialization
3. Display manager launch and user logs in
4. User session start
5. Startup Applications launch

### 3.2 File System Hierarchy

Follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) with some custom directories:
- /usr/share/icons icons or ~/.icons for themeing
- /usr/share/themes or ~/.themes for themeing
- /usr/lib/Cinstall for the Acreetion Installer

The remainder of software comes from the secured AcreetionOS Repositories.

### 3.3 User Management

Utilizes systemd-logind for user session management and PAM for authentication.

### 3.4 Networking

NetworkManager handles network connections, with a custom GUI front-end for easy user configuration within the Cinnamon Desktop Environment. In the terminal the user can use NMCLI, a TUI for NetworkManager.

## 4. Security Architecture

- SELinux for mandatory access control
    We are using SELinux for the ability to do as we please. SELinux is more complicated than Apparmor is but allows for more control on how applications are isolated. It is also more specific by specifying files via an inode number instead of a path.   
- Regular security updates through the package manager, which are pulling from a self-hosted and secured repository. 
- Firewall management is done through firewalld, and if the user wants to configure their own firewall, they can use GUFW, which uses software such as IPTables,etc.


## 5. Customization and Extension
- Acreetion OS launches with it's own set of themes. The themes may borrowed from other developer, and all credits are given on their README's.
- Cinnamon comes with the ability to theme, as well as use plugins. Future custom plugins make occur.
- Hook scripts may be installed depending on what hardware the user uses. In the case of Nvidia, Intel ARC, for instance, the hook is used to intall the GPU Drivers using DKMS.

## 6. Build and Release Process for the ISO image.

- Automated build system within Gitea
- ISO creation using custom scripts based on archiso within Gitea
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for testing and releasing within a containerized and isolated environment.

This architecture is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing for easy customization and extension as the project evolves.

## 7. Build and Release Process for Packages.
Issue Description

The AcreetionOS Linux Project uses build machines, virtual machines, Docker containers, and more to build packages and test packages. Those containers pull source code and build packages using makepkg [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg]. Each day the containers pull from the project maintainers repositories of the packages below:

If the package change is found, it's source code gets pulled, as well as it's readme and builds against PKGBUILDs we have built/found. Once package are built the packages are put through a testing process for each packager to build successfully with Makepkg, and then be ran through the Cinstall [the in house AcreetionOS installer] script with automated inputs to prove the package installs successfully. If the package installs, then the package is pushed over to a private repository for "Manual Checking"; this repository is known as the TESTING AcreetionOS Repository. If the package does not succeed, the server writes out a log entry, as well as copies the README of the specified project, into a private repository on the gitea instance, in a repository called "Errors"; afterward sending a ping to project maintainers dedicated devices letting them know of the failure. Afterward developers manually investigate the issue from look for a fix with manual intervention. When the package gets to "Manual Checking", this package is in the TESTING AcreetionOS Repository, of which testers are running these packages on their daily driver machines.

In the case of the TESTING AcreetionOS Repository, it is ran on a "True until proven False" system, which assumes that the package is safe and tested unless the maintainer intervenes, removing the said package. Once maintainers remove the package from the TESTING repository in the case of instability, an "Issue Report" template is sent to said maintainer, reminding them to look into the issue and take necessary action on the package as well as document the reason the package was removed from the temporary testing repository. When the package is removed, it is assumed that the package must be reinstated at some point before the next release period. If the package has not been reinstated within three days of the release cycle, a server sends a reminder for said package to be dealt with by said maintainer. Each release cycle is 14 days. In the case of the package reminder being ignored, the repository pulls the last stable version as a placeholder and sends a ping to the head maintainer's devices about said package. The head maintainers handle the packages by hand at this point if not dealt with accordingly. If the package is stable and not intervened with, it is ran through the CInstall script for a check to verify the package still installs. When the package installs it is pushed to the AcreetionOS main repository for users to use.

Steps to learn the AcreetionOS Package build process:

Find source code and clone all packages in list above.
Learn about PKGBUILD. Found here: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD]
Find/Make PKGBUILD for all packages above.
Learn about Makepkg: Found here: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg]
Build all packages in list above with Makepkg.
Learn about Arch Linux Repositories Found here:
[https://www.joram.io/blog/custom-arch-linux-package-repository/]
and
[https://www.arcolinuxiso.com/how-to-create-your-own-online-arch-linux-repository-on-github-and-use-it-on-any-arcolinux/]
Add package to testing repository.
Wait for maintainer to test package on system natively.
Maintainer tests package and remove invalid/unstable packages and server automatically pushes stable packages to repository.
Manual Intervention to the AcreetionOS package process.

Find source code for all packages in list above.
Find/Make PKGBUILD for all packages above.
Build all packages in list above with Makepkg.
Add package to testing repository.
Wait for maintainer to test package on system natively.
Maintainer tests package and remove invalid/unstable packages.
Server automatically pushes stable packages.

Semi-Automated Package Process.

Server looks at package name and searches Github and Gitlab for package name. It then finds the source code for each package from the list above and pulls said repositories into separate directories for each project.
The server then looks for a PKGBUILDs for said package within the Arch Linux reositories using pkgctl; more about pkgctl here: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_build_system]. In the case the package has no PKGBUILD within the primary Arch Linux repositories, it then pings a maintainer for manual intervention on their primary device. Maintainer then handles the package from here.
Once the server has got said PKGBUILDs, the server then builds all packages above; using Makepkg. More on Makepkg can be found here: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg] If Makepkg does not build successfully, a notification is sent to a maintainer on their designated device who then intervenes and fixes said issue.
After PKGBUILD successfully builds using Makepkg, server then puts packages into the TESTING repository.
Maintainer then tests package on system natively.
Maintainer then removes invalid/unstable packages and handle accordingly.
Server then automatically pushes stable packages to user repository.
Expected Behavior
The build system, testing system, as well as private repositories, lead to an experience where the user has very few system-level instabilities because of the long testing process of packages.
